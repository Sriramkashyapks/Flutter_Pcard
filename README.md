# portfolio

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Here I've Created my portfolio to get started with flutter and get a Hands-on experience in it. 
While building this project, I got to know about the basic skeleton of a Flutter App like widget, children, sizedBox, Scaffold and how to use the columns and rows to build the app.

Recomend you a few resources to get you started if you want to create your first Flutter project:

- Before you get started install all the dependencies required for smoother development experience.
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
